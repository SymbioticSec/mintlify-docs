<Info>
  **Prerequisites**
  - A Symbiotic Security account (ask your admin or Symbiotic point of contact for access)
  - Internet connection
</Info>

## Installation

### Download the CLI

Install Symbiotic Code using the following command:

<CodeGroup>

```bash For MacOS & Linux 
curl -sSL https://github.com/SymbioticSec/code/releases/latest/download/install.sh | bash
```

```bash For Windows
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -c "irm https://github.com/SymbioticSec/code/releases/latest/download/install.ps1 | iex"
```

</CodeGroup>

To launch Symbiotic Code, use the `symbiotic` command in your terminal.

<Warning>
You may need to run `chmod +x ~/.local/bin/symbiotic` to make the file executable.
</Warning>

### Update

If an update is available, the CLI will auto-update on teh next launch. 

## Authentication

<Info>
A Symbiotic Security account is required. If you don't have access, contact your administrator or Symbiotic point of contact.
</Info>

On first launch, you'll be prompted to enter your personal access token:

1. Click the link in the authentication modal to open the [Symbiotic Portal](https://app.symbioticsec.ai)
2. Create a new token or copy an existing one from your account settings
3. Paste the token into the modal and press **Enter**

Your token is securely stored and used for all subsequent operations.


## Using Symbiotic Code

### Common Commands

Use these slash commands within the Symbiotic Code interface:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/cd` | Change the working directory for the agent |
| `/session` | View conversation history and switch between sessions |
| `/new` | Start a new conversation session |

### Security Features

<CardGroup >
  <Card title="Guardrails" icon="shield-check">
    When working on an existing project, the agent retrieves your repository's security guardrails. These guardrails ensure all suggested implementations follow your company's standards and best practices.

  </Card>

  <Card title="Security Check" icon="scan-search">
    During feature implementation, the agent performs continuous security checks against OWASP security risks. If risks are identified, the agent automatically adjusts the implementation to ensure compliance.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Security Scan" icon="scan-line">
    After implementation completes, the agent runs a SAST security scan to identify potential vulnerabilities. The agent iterates on the code until all security issues are resolved.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>


## Quick Start Guide

### Test with Guardrails

Experience the value of AI-guided secure development:

1. Connect your GitHub account in the [Symbiotic Portal](https://app.symbioticsec.ai)
2. Create guardrails for one of your repositories
3. Open the repository in Symbiotic Code and ask it to implement a feature

You'll see the agent automatically retrieve and apply your configured guardrails.

### Security from Day One

Create a new project from scratch to see all security features in action:

1. Ask the agent to create a simple project (e.g., a weather app, to-do list, or CRM)
2. Observe the automatic guardrail generation
3. Watch security checks run during implementation
4. See the final security scan validate the code


## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| `command not found: symbiotic` | Ensure `~/.local/bin` is in your PATH and restart your terminal |
| Authentication fails | Verify your token is valid in the portal and hasn't expired |
| Permission denied | Run `chmod +x ~/.local/bin/symbiotic` |
