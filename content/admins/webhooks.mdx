## Configure a  webhook

To add a webhook, you will be asked :

- the endpoint URL
- which event you want to send

Once created, we will give you the signature key that you could use to verify webhook’s authenticity.

<Warning>
  Webhooks are shared across all users of an organization.
</Warning>

## Webhook format

Our webhooks payload are in a JSON format and follow the same structure :

→ `event` : the event name

→ `timestamp` : timestamp of when the webhook was sent

→ `data` : an object containing properties to describe the event

### Vulnerability Created

<CodeGroup>

```json Description
"data":{
      "pubkey": public key of the vulnerability - **string**
      "creator": email of the user that detected the vulnerability - **string**
      "rule_id": scanner_id of the rule - **string**
      "resource_path": path of the resource affected - **string**
      "created_at": vulnerability detection date - **timestamp**

## Verify webhooks

You can verify the authenticity of a Symbiotic webhook you receive using the signature key [available in your Symbiotic account](https://app.symbioticsec.ai/settings/webhook) and the header `symbioticsec_signature`

Signature is calculated using the following code on our side :

```python
import hashlib
import hmac
import json

def generate_signature(signing_secret: str, payload: dict) -> str:
    return hmac.new(
        bytes.fromhex(signing_secret),
        json.dumps(payload, sort_keys=True, separators=(",", ":")).encode(),
        hashlib.sha256,
    ).hexdigest()
```
