## Create organization guardrails

To help models generate secure code, you can create organization guardrails to add the security context of your organization.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Go to the AI Guardrails page and click on New in the Organization guardrails section.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Fill the form to explain the context of your organization. All questions are optional but recommended.
    <Info>
      If you used the other options, guardrails generation can take some time as our AI is processing your answers to generate tailored rules. 
    </Info>
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Rules will appear on the right panel. There you have multiple possibilities : 
    - Change the format of the file based on IDE used by developpers (NB: many IDEs like Cursor now support the [agents.md](http://agents.md) standard) 
    - Download the rules file that you can upload locally in your IDE or in your VCS to be shared with everyone. 
    - Copy rules to paste it in an already exiting rules file.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Create repository guardrails

To help models generate secure code, you can create repository guardrails to add security context specific to one or multiple repositories.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Go to the AI Guardrails page and click on New in the Repository guardrails section.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Select your Github organization and repositories you want to apply guardrails to. 
    We suggest selecting together only repositories that share the same context. 
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Fill the form to explain the context of the repository. All questions are optional but recommended. Select if you want to include organization guardrails or not and click on generate rules. 
    <Info>
      If you used the other options, guardrails generation can take some time as our AI is processing your answers to generate tailored rules. 
    </Info>
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Rules will appear on the right panel. There you have multiple possibilities : 
    - Change the format of the file based on IDE used by developpers (NB: many IDEs like Cursor now support the [agents.md](http://agents.md) standard) 
    - Download the rules file that you can upload locally in your IDE or in your VCS to be shared with everyone. 
    - Copy rules to paste it in an already exiting rules file.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Usage

To be used by models and coding agents, guardrails file must be placed in the repository in specific folder based on the agent : 
- Github Copilot: .github/instructions
- Claude: the root of the repository
- Agents.md: anywhere in the repository
