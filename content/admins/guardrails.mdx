After completing the form on the left panel, click on the _Generate Rules_ button. Rules will appear on the right panel. There you have multiple possibilities : 

1. Change the format of the file based on IDE used by developpers (NB: many IDEs like Cursor now support the [agents.md](http://agents.md) standard) 
2. Download the rules file that you can upload locally in your IDE or in your VCS to be shared with everyone. 
3. Copy rules to paste it in an already exiting rules file.
