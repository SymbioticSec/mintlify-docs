## Add users

<Warning>


Before adding users, you have to specify allowed domains in the dedicated section.

</Warning>

You have 3 options to add users : 

1. **Manually** by writing emails one by one and pressing enter between each email
2. **Via CSV,** by importing a CSV file with a column containing the email list. The file must contain only a column with the `email` as a name
3. **Via a registration link**, that can be shared and contains a token allowing any people with the link and an email of the authorized domains to create an account.
