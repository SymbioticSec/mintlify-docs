## Detection
Each time your code is saved (either manually or via the auto-save feature), a local detection scans for any vulnerabilities you may have created. When a vulnerability is found, it appears as a red underline beneath the vulnerable resource or property.

## Treeview

Our treeview allows you to see all vulnerabilities detected in the current workspace.
By default issues are grouped by file and ordered by severity :

<Icon icon="chevrons-up" color="#FF4040" size={20}/> Critical

<Icon icon="chevron-up" color="#E57260" size={20}/> High

<Icon icon="equal" color="#E5C166" size={20}/> Medium

<Icon icon="chevron-down" color="#6AD9A9" size={20}/> Low


Ignored issues are shown using this icon <Icon icon="ban" color="#939599" size={20}/>

Using actions in the treeview you can filter issues, change the grouping or search for a specific vulnerability.

## Details views
When you click on an issue in the treeview or in the More details link in the hover, a details view will open with 3 tabs :

    <Tabs>
    <Tab title="Overview">
    
    This tab contains all the informations you need about the vulnerability, including its description, potential impacts, other vulnerable examples, links to documentation and an AI generated remediation suggestion. It also allow you to access trainings on the vulnerability, ignore it or report it as a false positive.
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Assistant">
    
    This tab allows you to chat with our AI about this vulnerability. You can use presets to start a discussion or ask any question you have.
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Occurrences">
    
    If the same vulnerability appears on other resources in the opened workspace, you will find links to those vulnerable resources in this tab.
    </Tab>
    </Tabs>

## Hover
