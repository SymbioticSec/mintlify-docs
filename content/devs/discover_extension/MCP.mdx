<Info>
  If you need an introduction on MCP, here is the [get Started article of the protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro).
</Info>

## Setup

<Note>
  MCP setup is independant from our extension (that you can download and install [here](/content/devs/intro/intro))
</Note>

### MCP download & build

To use the Symbiotic Security MCP, you first need to install our CLI and build the MCP from source.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install our CLI">
    Download and install our CLI  using the command below.\
    The installer will automatically select the correct version for your environment.

    ```bash
          curl -sSL https://github.com/SymbioticSec/cli/releases/latest/download/install.sh | bash
          echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"'
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Clone our MCP repository">
    Clone the official Symbiotic Security MCP repository:

    ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/SymbioticSec/mcp.git
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install and build the MCP">
    Navigate into the repository and build the MCP:

    ```bash
    cd mcp  
    npm install
    npm run build
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Retrieve the index.js filepath">
    After the build completes, a `build` directory will be created.\
    Locate the **full path** to `build/index.js` — you will need it to configure the MCP in your IDE.

    <Info>
      You can retrieve it using the command `realpath build/index.js` in the MCP repository.
    </Info>
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Installation in your IDE

To use the MCP inside your IDE, you must declare it in your MCP settings.

You will need:

1. The full filepath of the index.js file we retrieved during the build of the MCP
2. Your Symbiotic personal access token that you can create and retrieve [here](https://app.symbioticsec.ai/settings/api-token)

Once you have these, configure the MCP using the examples below:

<CodeGroup>

```json In VS Code
{
 "servers": {
  "symbiotic-security": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["path_of_the_index.js_file"],
      "env": {
        "SYMBIOTIC_API_TOKEN": "your_token_here"
      }
    }
  },
}
```


```json In other IDEs
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "symbiotic-security": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["path_of_the_index.js_file"],
      "env": {
        "SYMBIOTIC_API_TOKEN": "your_token_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

</CodeGroup>

## Usage

Once configured, you can use the MCP directly from your IDE’s chat interface by asking it to perform a security scan on a file.

If you want your chat agent to automatically scan every piece of AI-generated code, we recommend adding the following MCP usage rule:

```markdown
ALWAYS use symbiotic-security MCP with the security_scan_files tool EACH time you generate code to scan for security vulnererabilities and remediate issues found.

ALWAYS try to fix issues found by the scanner. 
```
