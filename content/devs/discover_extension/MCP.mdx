  If you need an introduction on MCP, here is the [get Started article of the protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro).

## Setup

### MCP download & build

<Note>
  MCP setup is independant from our extension (that you can download and install [here](/content/devs/intro/intro))
</Note>

To use the Symbiotic Security MCP, you first need to install our CLI and build the MCP from source.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install our CLI">
    Download and install our CLI  using the command below.\
    The installer will automatically select the correct version for your environment.

    ```bash
          curl -sSL https://github.com/SymbioticSec/cli/releases/latest/download/install.sh | bash
          echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"'
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Clone our MCP repository">
    Clone the official Symbiotic Security MCP repository:

    ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/SymbioticSec/mcp.git
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install and build the MCP">
    Navigate into the repository and build the MCP:

    ```bash
    cd mcp  
    npm install
    npm run build
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Retrieve the index.js filepath">
    After the build completes, a `build` directory will be created.\
    Locate the **full path** to `build/index.js` — you will need it to configure the MCP in your IDE.

    <Info>
      You can retrieve it using the command `realpath build/index.js` in the MCP repository.
    </Info>
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Installation in your IDE

To use the MCP inside your IDE, you must declare it in your MCP settings.

You will need:

1. The full filepath of the index.js file we retrieved during the build of the MCP
2. Your Symbiotic personal access token that you can create and retrieve [here](https://app.symbioticsec.ai/settings/api-token)

#### Antigravity

          "command": "node",
          "args": ["path_of_the_index.js_file"],
          "env": {
            "SYMBIOTIC_API_TOKEN": "your_token_here"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
3. Activate the server using **MCP: List Servers** and selecting **symbiotic-security**, and selecting **Start Server**.

#### Continue.dev

1. In continue.dev extension settings add a new MCP
2. Enter the following configuration:
    ```yaml
    mcpServers:
      - name: Symbiotic Security
        command: node
        args:
          - "path_of_the_index.js_file"
        env: {
          "SYMBIOTIC_API_TOKEN": "your_token_here"
        }
    ```

#### Cursor

1. `CTRL/CMD + P` and search for **Cursor Settings**.
2. In the settings, find the **Tools & MCP** section.
3. Click on **New MCP Server** and enter the following configuration:
    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "symbiotic-security": {
          "command": "node",
          "args": ["path_of_the_index.js_file"],
          "env": {
            "SYMBIOTIC_API_TOKEN": "your_token_here"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
#### Kiro

1. `CTRL/CMD + P` and search for **Kiro: Open MCP Config**.
2. Enter the following configuration, and save the file.
    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "symbiotic-security": {
          "command": "node",
          "args": ["path_of_the_index.js_file"],
          "env": {
            "SYMBIOTIC_API_TOKEN": "your_token_here"
          },
          "disabled": false
        }
      }
    }
    ```

<Info>
  To ensure the MCP is used we advise you to create an [Agent Hook](https://docs.kiro.ai/docs/agent-hooks) in Kiro with the following prompt: 
  ```markdown
  Run the security_scan_files tool from the symbiotic-security MCP server on the file that was just edited. 
  Analyze all security issues found in the scan results and correct each issue by modifying the file appropriately. 
  Make sure to address every vulnerability identified. 
  Rescan after modification to ensure all issues have been corrected and none were introduced.
  ```

#### Others

Hundreds of other tools now support MCP servers, you can configure them to use the Symbiotic MCP server with the following settings:

* **Command**: `node`
* **Arguments**: `path_of_the_index.js_file`
* **Environment**: `SYMBIOTIC_API_TOKEN` with your token



## Usage

Once configured, you can use the MCP directly from your IDE’s chat interface by asking it to perform a security scan on a file.

If you want your chat agent to automatically scan every piece of AI-generated code, we recommend adding the following MCP usage rule:

```markdown
ALWAYS use symbiotic-security MCP with the security_scan_files tool EACH time you generate code to scan for security vulnererabilities and remediate issues found.

ALWAYS try to fix issues found by the scanner. 
```
