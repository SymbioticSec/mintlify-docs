<Info>
  If you need an introduction on MCP, here is the [get Started article of the protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro).
</Info>

<Note>
  MCP setup is independant from our extension (that you can download and install [here](/content/devs/intro/intro))
</Note>

## Setup

<Check>
  **Good news!** If you use Antigravity, Cursor, Kiro, VS Code, or Windsurf, and our extension is installed, everything is set up automatically. The MCP installs and configures itself, nothing for you to do.
</Check>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install our CLI">
    To use the Symbiotic Security MCP, you first need to download and install our CLI using the command below. The installer will automatically select the correct version for your environment.

    ```bash
          curl -sSL https://github.com/SymbioticSec/cli/releases/latest/download/install.sh | bash
          echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"'
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open MCP configuration in your IDE">
    In your IDE, use `CTRL/CMD + P` and search for **MCP: Open User Configuration** to open the configuration file that should be called `settings.json`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add MCP Configuration">
    Once the file opened, paste this configuration:

    ```json
    {
        "mcpServers": {
          "symbiotic-security": {
            "command": "npx",
            "args": ["@symbioticsec/symbiotic-mcp-server"],
            "env": {
              	"SYMBIOTIC_API_TOKEN": "your_token_here",
        		"SYMBIOTIC_CLI_PATH": "cli_path_here"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Input your API token">
    Retrieve your  personal access token [here](https://app.symbioticsec.ai/settings/api-token) and paste it in the `SYMBIOTIC_API_TOKEN` variable

  </Step>
  <Step title="Input the CLI path">
    Retrieve the path of the CLI you installed in step 1 and paste it in the `SYMBIOTIC_CLI_PATH` variable

    <Info>
      You can retrieve it using the command `which symbiotic-cli
` in a terminal.
    </Info>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save and launch the MCP">
    Save the file and launch the MCP server by clicking on Start above teh MCP name in the configuration file or by using the **MCP: List Servers** command and selecting **symbiotic-security**, and selecting **Start Server**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Examples

#### Continue.dev

1. In continue.dev extension settings add a new MCP
2. Enter the following configuration:

   ```yaml
   mcpServers:
     - name: Symbiotic Security
       command: node
       args:
         - "path_of_the_index.js_file"
       env: {
         "SYMBIOTIC_API_TOKEN": "your_token_here"
       }
   ```


#### Zed

1. `CMD + ,` to open Zed settings.
2. Add the following:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "symbiotic-security": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["path_of_the_index.js_file"],
      "env": {
        "SYMBIOTIC_API_TOKEN": "your_token_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Others

Hundreds of other tools now support MCP servers, you can configure them to use the Symbiotic MCP server with the following settings:

- **Command**: `npx`
- **Arguments**: `"@symbioticsec/symbiotic-mcp-server"`
- **Environment**:

  ```jsonc
  "SYMBIOTIC_API_TOKEN": "your_api_token",
  "SYMBIOTIC_CLI_PATH": "cli_path"
  ```

## Usage

Once configured, you can use the MCP directly from your IDE’s chat interface by asking it to perform a security scan on a file.

If you want your chat agent to automatically scan every piece of AI-generated code, we recommend adding the following MCP usage rule:

```markdown
ALWAYS use symbiotic-security MCP with the security_scan_files tool EACH time you generate code to scan for security vulnererabilities and remediate issues found.

ALWAYS try to fix issues found by the scanner. 
```
