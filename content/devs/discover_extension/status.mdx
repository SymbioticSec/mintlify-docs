At the bottom of the editor, in the status bar, you can see our snippet that could indicate diverse statuses : 
    - The extension is actually scanning 
    - Issues have been found (the snippet is in red with the number of policy breaching issues detected)
    - No issues have been found
    - Errors or problems (the snippet is in yellow with the error message)
