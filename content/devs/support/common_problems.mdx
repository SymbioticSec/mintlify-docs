### CLI is seen as a malware by Windows

We've requested to be whitelisted by Microsoft, but depending on your system's update status, our CLI used by the IDE extension might be detected as malware. 

To force an update of Windows Defender's malware definitions, please follow these steps: 

1. Open command prompt as administrator and change directory to c:\Program Files\Windows Defender
2. Run "MpCmdRun.exe -removedefinitions -dynamicsignatures"
3. Run "MpCmdRun.exe -SignatureUpdate"

Alternatively, the latest definition is available for download [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/manage-updates-baselines-microsoft-defender-antivirus)

### Login issues with browser redirection

If youâ€™re not able to log in using the browser redirection, you can do it by using your token : 

1. Go https://app.symbioticsec.ai/settings/api-token
2. Click on the token to open it on a side panel 

3. Copy your token 

    
4. In the IDE search the command 
`> Symbiotic Security : Provide authentication token`

    
5. Paste you token and press ENTER
    

ðŸŽ‰Â Youâ€™re now authenticated. Wait a few seconds and a scan will be launched.
