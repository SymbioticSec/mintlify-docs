### CLI is seen as a malware by Windows

We've requested to be whitelisted by Microsoft, but depending on your system's update status, our CLI used by the IDE extension might be detected as malware. 

To force an update of Windows Defender's malware definitions, please follow these steps: 

1. Open command prompt as administrator and change directory to c:\Program Files\Windows Defender
2. Run "MpCmdRun.exe -removedefinitions -dynamicsignatures"
3. Run "MpCmdRun.exe -SignatureUpdate"

Alternatively, the latest definition is available for download [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/manage-updates-baselines-microsoft-defender-antivirus)

### SSL Certificate issue / TLS Inspection 

If you encounter issues installing our extension with SSL certificate errors, it might be due to a TLS Inspection on your side. 

You can try to whitelist our domain `*.symbioticsec.ai` in your TLS Inspection settings. 


### Login issues with browser redirection

If you’re not able to log in using the browser redirection, you can do it by using your token : 

1. Go https://app.symbioticsec.ai/settings/api-token
2. Click on the token to open it on a side panel 

3. Copy your token 

    
4. In the IDE search the command 
`> Symbiotic Security : Provide authentication token`

    
5. Paste you token and press ENTER
    

🎉 You’re now authenticated. Wait a few seconds and a scan will be launched.
