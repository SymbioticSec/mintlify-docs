## What’s a support bundle ?

A support bundle is a diagnostic zip file generated when you encounter issues with the Symbiotic Security IDE extension. It helps us investigate and resolve your case more effectively. Once generated, the support bundle is securely stored on our servers and automatically deleted after the investigation is completed.

The support bundle contains essential information for debugging, including:

- **IDE Extension Logs**: Logs generated by the extension itself.
- **Detection Scanner Logs**: Logs related to the scanner used for detecting vulnerabilities.
- **Environment Logs**: System-level information such as machine type, operating system, and related environment details.
- **Files From the Open Workspace**: Only the files involved in detection activities are included (see [How to configure support bundle content ?](https://www.notion.so/How-to-configure-support-bundle-content-162d0df03fd380d0ad71d280eb82ae8a?pvs=21))

## How to generate a support bundle ?

There are two ways to generate a support bundle:

1. **Automatically After an Error**:
    
    If the extension encounters an error, you’ll see a notification in the extension tree view. This notification includes a button to generate a support bundle directly.
    
2. **Manually via Command**:
    
    Use the command palette in your IDE and run the following command:
    
    `> Symbiotic Security: Upload Support Bundle`
    

## How to configure support bundle content ?

You can customize the content of the support bundle to suit your privacy preferences.

In the extension settings, you can deactivate the inclusion of workspace files used during detection. This ensures that only log and environment details are included in the bundle.
