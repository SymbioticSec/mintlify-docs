title: "Configure detection"
description: "Configure vulnerabilities that should be blocking in CI or ignored using our configuration file"
---

Using our configuration file you can tailor the detection to your context and focus on whatâ€™s important to remediate. It allows you to define `Policy Breaching` vulnerabilities (that will be highlighted in the IDE and blocking in CI) but also which vulnerabilities to ignore.

Those configurations can be written based on the file path, severity, language, vulnerability id provider or service.

To be taken into account the YAML file must be named `symbiotic.yml` and placed at the root of the repository.

Here are some templates of configuration file, you can use to start :

<CodeGroup>

```yaml Minimal
# SYMBIOTIC SECURITY CONFIGURATION FILE
ignored:
	vulnerabilities:
		#ID of vulnerabilities you want to ignore in the repository
		- SYM_PY_001
		- SYM_JSTS_003# SYMBIOTIC SECURITY CONFIGURATION FILE
```


```yaml Basic
# SYMBIOTIC SECURITY CONFIGURATION FILE
blocking:
	vulnerabilities:
		#ID of vulnerabilities that must block CI if detected
		- SYM_PY_001
		- SYM_JSTS_003# SYMBIOTIC SECURITY CONFIGURATION FILE
ignored:
	vulnerabilities:
		#ID of vulnerabilities you want to ignore in the repository
		- SYM_PY_001
		- SYM_JSTS_003# SYMBIOTIC SECURITY CONFIGURATION FILE
```

# SYMBIOTIC SECURITY CONFIGURATION FILE
# =========================================


# --------------------------------------------
# SECTION: blocking
# Defines what is considered blocking in CI.
# --------------------------------------------
blocking:

  # Minimum severity level that will cause a detection to fail the CI pipeline.
  # Possible values: low, medium, high, critical
  severity_threshold: high

  # List of cloud providers for which *all* related vulnerabilities
  # are treated as blocking, regardless of their individual severity.
  providers:
     - Azure
  #   - AWS
  #   - Google

  # Specific cloud services per provider where *all* vulnerabilities
  # are considered blocking.
  services:
    AWS:
      - s3         # Example: Block any unsafe or non-compliant usage of S3
    # Google:
    #   - compute   # Example: Block misconfigurations in Google Compute Engine
    #   - gke       # Example: Block issues in Google Kubernetes Engine

  # Explicit list of vulnerability IDs that are always treated as blocking.
  #vulnerabilities:
  #   - TF-0444
  #   - TF-0081
  #   - TF-0201

# ------------------------------------------------------------
# SECTION: ignored
# Defines what will be ignored in the IDE and CLI.
# Ignored rules take priority over blocking rules.
# ------------------------------------------------------------
ignored:

  # Maximum severity level below which detections are ignored.
  severity_threshold: low

  # List of file paths or glob patterns to exclude from analysis.
  # Wildcards are supported (e.g., "*/azure/*")
  paths:
    - "*/azure/*"      # Example: Ignore all files inside "azure" directories

  # Languages to exclude from analysis.
  #languages:
  #   - terraform
  #   - go
  
  # List of cloud providers for which *all* related vulnerabilities
  # are treated as blocking, regardless of their individual severity.
  #providers:
  #   - Azure
  #   - AWS
  #   - Google

  # Specific cloud services to exclude from detection, per provider.
  #services:
  #   AWS:
  #     - documentdb
  #     - elasticache

  # Vulnerability IDs to explicitly ignore, even if they appear in blocking lists.
  vulnerabilities:
  #   - TF-0010
  #   - TF-0213
  #   - TF-0399

# =====================================================
# END OF CONFIGURATION
# =====================================================
# ðŸ’¡ Tips:
# - Keep this file version-controlled and up to date.
# - Use comments to track reasoning for each rule (e.g., why something is ignored).
