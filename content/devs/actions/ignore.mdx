# How to ignore a vulnerability ?

![Trae 2025-07-31 14:58:30 - Frame 13159.png](attachment:7bf6248b-99fe-48ac-bd9a-e497cda051b3:Trae_2025-07-31_145830_-_Frame_13159.png)

If a vulnerability is not relevant, you can ignore it directly from the IDE. 

Based on the scope of your ignore you have two possibilities : 

1. If you want to ignore on this specific issues or issues in this file, click on the ignore button in the detailed view of a vulnerability and choose :
    - Ignore: The detection is correct but you want still to ignore this issue
    - Declare a false positive: The detection is incorrect and you want to flag a false positive
2. If you want to ignore this vulnerability on the whole repository, you can use the [Configuration File](https://www.notion.so/Configuration-File-1d6d0df03fd38087b3f1c30253c85a99?pvs=21) 

## Ignore comment

The ignore comment will be generated by clicking on the ignore button, but you can also write it yourself by following this syntax : 

`# nosymbiotic {rule_id} -- {ignore_comment}`

To ignore multiple rules you can write all the rules you want to ignore separated by a comma :

`# nosymbiotic {rule_id},{rule_id} -- {ignore_comment}`

## Declare a false positive

You can declare a false positive by adding a tag `-fp` in the ignore comment or by using the action available in the issue hover or the ignore button. 

In that case, you will be ask to select the scope of the false positive and give an explanation about it. This part is really important as it allows us to review false positives with your admins and make the detection pattern evolve.

NB : Every ignored vulnerability is still visible in the treeview of the extension.

# How to configure detection ?

Using our [Configuration File](https://www.notion.so/Configuration-File-1d6d0df03fd38087b3f1c30253c85a99?pvs=21) you can tailor the detection to your context and focus on whatâ€™s important to remediate. 

This file allow you to define `Policy Breaching` vulnerabilities (that will be highlighted in the IDE and blocking in CI) but also which vulnerabilities to ignore. 

Those configurations can be written based on the file path, severity, language, vulnerability id provider or service.
