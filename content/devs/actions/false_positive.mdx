You can declare a false positive by adding a tag `-fp` in the ignore comment or by using the action available in the issue hover or the ignore button. 

In that case, you will be ask to select the scope of the false positive and give an explanation about it. This part is really important as it allows us to review false positives with your admins and make the detection pattern evolve.
